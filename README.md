# kali-toolbox-installer

This script makes it easy to use important Kali tools for CTF competitions, doing the work for you and saving time.



## Instalation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KeepSharp101/kali-toolbox-installer.git
```

I created this script to be super easy to tweak. Feel free to throw in any tools you like. Just a heads up, it's built to run on a Kali Linux machine and uses the 'apt' package manager.
